•  Worked on exploring and decoding the KPC genes responsible for the phenomenon of Multi Drug-resistance (MDR) in many pathogenic strains specially bacteria like Klebsiella pneumoniae.

•  Using the protein coded by KPC genes i.e. Carbapenam Hydrolyzing Beta Lectamase as basis drew inferences regarding protein structure changes and amino acids responsible for the pathogenicity and drug resistance phenomenon.

•  Worked on analyzing and predicting the structure of query protein through Protein Homology Modelling and protein-drug interactions through Docking.
