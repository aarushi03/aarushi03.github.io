## Internships

**<span class="fa fa-briefcase about-icon"></span>Summer Research Intern, Inter University Accelerator Centre, New Delhi, India (2017)**

* Made an **Ethernet based server for remotely controlling a P.I.D. Controller device** for advance studies on ions and their nature.
* Did **network analysis using network analysis tools like Wireshark** in order to trace out the problem in the existing network.
* Used **LabVIEW for making high pass and low pass filters, designing integrators and differentiators and making filter** for one of the projects on which my mentor is working regarding multipurpose device which can be both used as multiplier and noise filter in electronic communication.

**<span class="fa fa-briefcase about-icon"></span>Summer Research Intern, India Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore, India (2018)**

* Worked on **exploring and decoding the KPC genes responsible for the phenomenon of Multi Drug-resistance (MDR)** in many pathogenic strains specially bacteria like Klebsiella pneumoniae.
* Using the **protein coded by KPC genes i.e. Carbapenam Hydrolyzing Beta Lectamase** as basis drew inferences regarding protein structure changes and amino acids responsible for the pathogenicity and drug resistance phenomenon.
* Worked on **analyzing and predicting the structure of query protein through Protein Homology Modelling and protein-drug interactions through Docking.**

**<span class="fa fa-briefcase about-icon"></span>Summer Research Intern, University of British Columbia(UBC), B.C., Canada (2019)**

* Worked on two projects **using data extraction, pre-processing, filtering, data analysis, bioinformatics algorithms and huge amount of statistical analysis, graphical analysis and machine learning using Random Forest and K means clustering.**
* First project consisted of **Analysis of data pertaining to Fecal Microbiome Transplant (FMT)**, a leading technology, including patient and donor observations.
* Second project **focused on Functional Annotation of Cannabis Genome** for long term genetic modification of Cannabis plant.
* Currently working on two projects **pertaining to micro biome impacts and studies, and opioid analysis for microbial dysbiosis.**
