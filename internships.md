## Internships

**Summer Research Intern, Inter University Accelerator Centre, New Delhi, India (2017)**

* Made an Ethernet based server for remotely controlling a P.I.D. Controller device for advance studies on ions and their nature.
* Did network analysis using network analysis tools like Wireshark in order to trace out the problem in the existing network.
* Used LabVIEW for making high pass and low pass filters, designing integrators and differentiators and making filter for one of the projects on which my mentor is working regarding multipurpose device which can be both used as multiplier and noise filter in electronic communication.

**Summer Research Intern, India Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore, India (2018)**

* Used LabVIEW for making high pass and low pass filters, designing integrators and differentiators and making filter for one of the projects on which my mentor is working regarding multipurpose device which can be both used as multiplier and noise filter in electronic communication.
* Using the protein coded by KPC genes i.e. Carbapenam Hydrolyzing Beta Lectamase as basis drew inferences regarding protein structure changes and amino acids responsible for the pathogenicity and drug resistance phenomenon.
* Worked on analyzing and predicting the structure of query protein through Protein Homology Modelling and protein-drug interactions through Docking.

**Summer Research Intern, University of British Columbia(UBC), B.C., Canada (2019)**

* Worked on two projects using data extraction, pre-processing, filtering, data analysis, bioinformatics algorithms and huge amount of statistical analysis, graphical analysis and machine learning using Random Forest and K means clustering.
* First project consisted of Analysis of data pertaining to Fecal Microbiome Transplant (FMT), a leading technology, including patient and donor observations.
